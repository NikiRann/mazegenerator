Greetings! This is my maze generator. It uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to create the perfect maze. The mazes which this algorithm create are perfect(with no loops) and they are basically a tree. The algorithm is simillar to DFS, because it uses stack. We call createRecursivePath() to create our beautifull maze.
